The first column contains the cancer type, with 0 indicating the ALL class and 1 indicating the AML class. Columns 2-7130 contain expression levels of 7129 genes recorded from each tissue sample. \n",

Take a peak at your training set: you should notice the severe differences in the measurements from one gene to the next (some are negative, some hover around zero, and some are well into the thousands).

    "`D49818_at`, `M23161_at`, `hum_alu_at`, `AFFX-PheX-5_at`, `M15990_at`. By observing the heat map, comment on which of these genes are useful in discriminating between the two classes.\n",

Is there a problem with this interpretation?\n",

Evaluate the classification accuracy (1 - misclassification rate) of the obtained classification model on both the training and test sets.\n",

    "3. Next, fit a simple logistic regression model to the training set. How does the training and test calssification accuracy of this model compare with the linear regression model?  Remember, you need to set the regularization parameter for sklearn's logistic regression function to be a very large value in order not to regularize (use 'C=100000').\n",

The function creates a visualization that places the data points on a vertical line based on the predicted probabilities, with the `ALL` and `AML` classes shown in different colors, and with the 0.5 threshold highlighted using a dotted horizontal line.  Is there a difference in the spread of probabilities in the training and test plots? Are there data points for which the predicted probability is close to 0.5?
